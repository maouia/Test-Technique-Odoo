# Odoo 15 Customization Project

This project is based on Odoo 15, sourced directly from the GitHub repository. It includes customizations for managing post publications and web scraping functionalities.

## Setup

1. **Odoo Version**: The project uses Odoo 15 from the GitHub version. 

2. **Python Virtual Environment**: A Python virtual environment (`venv`) is created for this project to manage dependencies. Due to the large size of the Odoo folder and the virtual environment, these are not included in the repository.

## Web Scraping

The project utilizes `BeautifulSoup4` and `requests` for web scraping. A Jupyter notebook for testing the scraping script is located in the `scraping_test` folder. The script is designed to extract data from a selected website that matches the projectâ€™s needs.

## Custom Models

Custom models for managing post publications are developed and located in the `custom_models/posts_management` folder. These models facilitate the creation and management of posts within the Odoo system.
